# This should install pyproject.toml's minimum accepted versions.

# Minimum for GitHub security alerts
Pillow==12.1.1
# Minimum for dtypes which is convenient for TorchExtractor.load_weights()
numpy==1.25.0
# Minimum for numpy 1.25 (found through experimentation; seems the scipy
# pyproject.toml history isn't accurate to the releases?)
# scikit-learn compat only needs 1.6+
scipy==1.9.2
scikit-learn==1.5.2
# Not minimum for GitHub security alerts (that'd be 2.8), but this is a
# big package to pin to a very recent version.
# In SageMaker, for example, their default version is a bit behind,
# and the install time can make it onerous to use a newer one.
torch==2.8.0
# Should correspond with torch version
torchvision==0.21.0
# Minimum for Python 3.10
boto3==1.26.115
